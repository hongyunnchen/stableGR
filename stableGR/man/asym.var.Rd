\usage{
asym.var(x, multivariate = TRUE, method = "lug", size = "sqroot",
  autoburnin = FALSE, adjust = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a list of matrices, where each matrix is \eqn{n \times p}. Each row of the matrices represents one step of the chain. Each column of the matrices represents one variable. A list with a single matrix (chain) is allowed. Optionally, this can be an \code{mcmclist} object.}

\item{multivariate}{a logical flag indicating whether the full matrix is returned (TRUE) or only the diagonals (FALSE)}

\item{method}{the method used to compute the matrix. This is one of \dQuote{\code{lug}} (lugsail, the default), \dQuote{\code{bm}} (batch means), \dQuote{\code{obm}} (overlapping batch means), \dQuote{\code{tukey}} (spectral variance method with a Tukey-Hanning window), or \dQuote{\code{bartlett}} (spectral variance method with a Bartlett window).}

\item{size}{can take character values of \code{sqroot} and \code{cuberoot} or any numeric value between 1 and \eqn{n}. Size represents the batch size in \dQuote{\code{bm}} (batch means) and the truncation point in \dQuote{\code{bartlett}} and \dQuote{\code{tukey}}. sqroot means size is floor(n^(1/2) and cuberoot means size is floor(n^(1/3)).}

\item{autoburnin}{a logical flag indicating whether only the second half of the series should be used in the computation.  If set to TRUE and \code{start(x)} is less than \code{end(x)/2} then start of series will be adjusted so that only second half of series is used.}

\item{adjust}{a logical flag indicating whether the covariance matrix should be adjusted, when necessary, to ensure it is positive-definite.}
}
\value{
The asymptotic variance estimate (if \code{multivariate = FALSE}) or the asymptotic covariance matrix (if \code{multivariate = TRUE}) in the Markov chain central limit theorem.
}
\description{
Estimates the asymptotic covariance matrix for Monte Carlo estimators,  compatible with multiple chains. If a single chain is input, it calls \code{mcmcse::mcse.multi}.
}
\details{
The function returns estimate of the univariate or multivariate asymptotic (co)variance of Monte Carlo estimators. If \eqn{X_1, \dots X_n} are the MCMC samples, then function returns the estimate of \eqn{\lim_{n\to \infty} n Var(\bar{X})}. In other words, if a Markov chain central limit holds such that, as \eqn{n \to \infty}
  \deqn{\sqrt{n}(\bar{X} - \mu) \to N(0, \Sigma) }
then the function returns an estimator of \eqn{\Sigma} from the m different chains. If \code{multivariate == FALSE}, then only the diaongal of \eqn{\Sigma} are returned.
