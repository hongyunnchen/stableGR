\usage{
stable.GR(
  x,
  multivariate = TRUE,
  mapping = "determinant",
  method = "lug",
  size = NULL,
  autoburnin = FALSE,
  blather = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a list of matrices, where each matrix represents one Markov chain sample. Each row of the matrices represents one step of the chain. Each column of the matrices represents one variable. A list with a single matrix (chain) is allowed. Optionally, this can be an \code{mcmclist} object.}

\item{multivariate}{a logical flag indicating whether the multivariate potential scale reduction factor should be calculated for multivariate chains.}

\item{mapping}{the function used to map the covariance matrix to a scalar. This is one of \dQuote{\code{determinant}} (determinant of the covariance matrix, the default) or \dQuote{\code{maxeigen}} (the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix).}

\item{method}{the method used to compute the standard error of the chains. This is one of \dQuote{\code{lug}} (lugsail, the default), \dQuote{\code{bm}} (batch means), \dQuote{\code{obm}} (overlapping batch means), \dQuote{\code{tukey}} (spectral variance method with a Tukey-Hanning window), or \dQuote{\code{bartlett}} (spectral variance method with a Bartlett window).}

\item{size}{options are \code{NULL} (default, which calculates an ideal batch size), character values of \code{sqroot} and \code{cuberoot}, or any numeric value between 1 and \eqn{n}. Size represents the batch size in \dQuote{\code{bm}} (batch means) and the truncation point in \dQuote{\code{bartlett}} and \dQuote{\code{tukey}}. sqroot means size is floor(n^(1/2) and cuberoot means size is floor(n^(1/3)).}

\item{autoburnin}{a logical flag indicating whether only the second half of the series should be used in the computation.  If set to TRUE and \code{start(x)} is less than \code{end(x)/2} then start of series will be adjusted so that only second half of series is used.}

\item{blather}{a logical flag indicating whether to include additional output.}
}
\value{
\item{psrf}{A vector containing the point estimates of the PSRF.}

\item{mpsrf}{A scalar point estimate of the multivariate PSRF.}

\item{means}{A vector containing the sample means based on the chains provided.}

\item{n.eff}{A scalar point estimate of the effective sample size.}

\item{blather}{Either \code{FALSE} or a list containing intermediate calculations.}
}
\description{
This function uses fast and strongly consistent estimators estimators of Monte Carlo variance to calculate the Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic for Markov chain Monte Carlo. A univariate `potential scale reduction factor' (PSRF) is calculated for each variable in \code{x}. For multivariate chains, a multivariate PSRF is calculated to take into account the interdependence of the chain's components.  The PSRFs decrease to 1 as the chain length increases. When the PSRF becomes sufficiently close to 1, the sample collected by the Markov chain has converged to the target distribution.
}
\section{Theory}{
 Gelman and Rubin (1992) and Brooks and Gelman (1998) first constructed the univariate and 
multivariate potential scale reduction factors (PSRF), respectively,  to diagnose Markov chain 
convergence. The function \code{stable.GR} stabilizes the PSRF and improves the PSRF's efficiency by 
incorporating lugsail estimators for the target variance. The PSRF decreases to 1 as the chain length
 increases; when the PSRF becomes sufficiently close to 1, the sample collected by the Markov chain has 
 converged to to the target distribution. A PSRF convergence threshold can be calculated using 
 \code{choosepsrf}.
